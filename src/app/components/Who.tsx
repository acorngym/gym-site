              My name is <span className="font-semibold text-slate-800">Trung Nguyen</span>. I am an NCSF certified personal trainer 
              and ENW certified fitness nutrition specialist. I am a 32-year-old male who loves 
              working out and helping people. I struggled earlier in my teens to gain weight, 
              but fitness helped me. I noticed how my attitude about life changed once I was in 
              better shapeâ€”people were even nicer to me than before. Most importantly, I became 
              more confident and said "yes" to more things in life.

              (Trung Nguyen). We are currently just one trainer and about 15 one-on-one clients. 
              Why Acorns? Acorns may be small, but they hold the potential of growing into tall 
              and strong oak trees. All they need is the right environment. Acorns are symbolic 
              for everyone, as each of us carries deep inside the vast potential for greatness. 
              We want to help bring that out of you.

              Our clients range from complete beginners to advanced fitness enthusiasts. We can 
              take you from wherever you may be in your fitness journey to the next level. 
              However, most of our clients are beginners. With a background in psychology, we 
              help overcome the obstacles people face when starting a fitness habit. If you are 
              someone who might be shy about going to the gym, or you want to start a healthy 
              habit but keep falling off, or you feel unhealthy (or just want to be healthier) 
              and are overwhelmed by conflicting information, we can help.
